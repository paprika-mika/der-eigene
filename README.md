# Wir Eigenen

**_The Unique/The Individual - Paper for male culture_**

Der Eigene was the first gay journal in the world, published from 1896 to 1932 by Adolf Brand in Berlin. Many men contributed poems, stories, political articles and nude photography. How do we look at this content with an eye of 2020?

_The Magazine_
At the IISH (International Institute for Social History) I looked into their selection of copies of Der Eigene, and scanned about half of them.

### _Production_

The magazine was published by Adolf Brand and had approximately **1500 subscriptions** per edition, but exact numbers do not exist.

The paper and general design of the magazine changed often during the 30 years it existed, but most of the time **black and white**, with the exception of some illustrations that had one color added.

The magazine was **locally printed in Berlin**, probably using an offset press. Often photos were printed on different paper in earlier issues. Later issues (around 1920) were completely printed on more glossy paper.

The magazine had a **soft cover and was stapled**, although there was one hard cover version in 1906's volume.


### _Contributors_

Known contributors, other then Adolf Brand himself were Benedict Friedlaender, Hanns Heinz Ewers, Erich Mühsam, Kurt Hiller, Ernst Burchard, John Henry Mackay, Theodor Lessing, Klaus Mann, and Thomas Mann, as well as artists Wilhelm von Gloeden, Fidus, and Sascha Schneider.

### _Context_

[What did Berlin look like around 1900 -1930](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-m9A8mY-U0)

During the period of publishing Der Eigene there was a lot of political tension in Germany. First of all, the main reason for publishing Der Eigene was [Paragraph 175](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph_175), a provision of the German Criminal Code from 15 May 1871 to 10 March 1994, that made homosexual acts between males a crime, and in early revisions the provision also criminalized bestiality as well as forms of prostitution and underage sexual abuse. All in all, around 140,000 men were convicted under the law.
During the World War I the publication could not publish for a few years, ofcourse. Then afterwards, the nazism started growing in the country and more it became harder to publish the magazine in a semi-secretive way. In 1932 the last Issue was made, due to the rise of Hitler in Nazi-Germany.



### _Queer Publishing_

Der Eigene was the very first gay magazine known, after which many magazines and publications worldwide were published, with the purpose of connecting LGBT+ people and to fight for equality. Many of which were or still are produced in secret because of the criminalisation of homosexuality.

### _Notes on transcoding the artifact_

How does coding play a role in this?

Is there 1 specific story witha  more specific meaning, how to transcode narrative?

(for instance mythology can stay in the world way longer then a specific 'boring' story)

Putting in in a different context, next to some other content, make it relatable, urgent.

Any other media in this topic? film, audio

Develop number of directions to go

Not one solution, different solutions

Language coding tool

Editable format, digital text

posibilities for translation, and for specific language to contemporary language

How would it read in the 20s, or in the 60s or now,

Or combine with visual aspects of gay culture over time

Making the urgency of it clear i process of transcoding, in technical process design process, format

so old so its open to interpretation, can be quite bold, not offending anyone
